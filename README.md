# PruebaRappi

This test is done with MVVM, Hilt, Room and View binding. A search engine is missing that for me I think it would be done with a text view and a filter in the adapter, as well as the unit tests that I would think can be done with Espresso or Mockito through Hilt consuming a service seeing the response that it brings up part of the service.
